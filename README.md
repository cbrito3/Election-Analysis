## Analysis of the Election Audit

# Overview of Election Audit 
This process is for carry out a new audit based on some new additional data that the election commission has provided. 
We have to provide the following in this new audit:
The voter turnout for each county
Track the winning candidate, vote count and percentage
Track the largest county and county voter turnout
The percentage of votes from each county based on the total count
The county with the highest turnout
Working from this moduleâ€™s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. 
Determine winning vote count, winning percentage, and candidate.
Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file. This will allow us to determine the winner of the election.

# Election-Audit Summary

Given that the data has large information on this election process, the script can be modified and adapted to the needs of the election commission. It would depend what they would require, but if we wanted to know the election based on states turnout, another option can be to write who the losers are.
